      '\n\nAlthough developing mobile applications fell outside my regular course of study, I was determined to master new techniques and concepts. I hope my determination comes through in this app, because I haven\'t worked with Flutter before.'
      '\n\nI hope that DTT can look past this and give me a chance to become a top Flutter developer and thus further strengthen the DTT team.'
